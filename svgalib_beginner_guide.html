<p><b>Easy Graphics: A Beginner's Guide to SVGAlib</b><br>
by <a href="mailto:jlink@svgalib.org">Jay Link</a>

<p>Are you looking for a simple graphics package for your Linux system? If
so, look no further. SVGAlib provides an easy way to create graphical
applications and eliminates the rigmarole of the X Window System. If you
have even the most rudimentary grasp of programming in C, then you can use
SVGAlib.

<p><b>What is SVGAlib?</b>

<p>SVGAlib is a low-level graphics library for Linux. It augments the C
programming language, which doesn't provide support for graphics.
 
<p><i>But there are lots of graphics programs written in C!</i>

<p>Yes, but they all rely on external library functions. C itself can only
give you text. That's because all graphic functions are system dependent
and are non-portable. Unfortunately, graphic routines coded for one
operating system will not work under another unless they are completely
rewritten. For example, graphics originally written for DOS or Windows are
useless under Linux.

<p>To code graphics in C under Linux, it is necessary to use an external
set of functions which are native to Linux. SVGAlib is one such set.

<p><b>How is SVGAlib different from the X Window System?</b>

<p>The X Window System (XFree86) is actually a server. This server must be
started prior to using any applications which require X. Furthermore, the
X server is unabashedly system-intensive (i.e. it's piggy with your
resources), and when using some video cards it will prohibit you from using
your virtual terminals (Alt 1-6).

<p>SVGAlib, on the other hand, requires no such preparation. You do not
"run"  SVGAlib like you do X Windows. SVGAlib is simply a binary C library
which is called by C programs, just like all the other libraries in /lib
and /usr/lib. If SVGAlib is properly installed, the average user shouldn't
even be aware of its existence. Finally, SVGAlib will not affect your
virtual terminals, leaving you free to run multiple applications like
always. You can have normal text on one terminal and graphics on another.

<p><b>Drawbacks</b>

<p>There are many more applications available for X Windows than there are
for SVGAlib, due to the fact that the X Window System is cross-platform
(it runs on a variety of UNIXes). Only Linux uses SVGAlib. Also,
poorly-written SVGAlib applications can mung-up your console, requiring a
reboot. Finally, you shouldn't switch back and forth quickly between two
consoles using SVGAlib graphics, or you risk screen corruption (forcing
another reboot).

<p>However, it is a myth that SVGAlib is a security risk. While SVGAlib
apps must be setuid root, that privilege is given up immediately after
execution. There is no need to be concerned.

<p>In summary, despite the aforementioned problems, SVGAlib's speed and
ease of use make it attractive in many situations. Especially if you just
want to doodle on the screen.

<p><b>Examples</b>

<p>To use SVGAlib, you must reference it in your C program. Simply
#include &lt;vga.h&gt; . Here's about the easiest SVGAlib program there
is:

<p><pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;vga.h&gt;
 
int main(void)
{
   vga_init();
   vga_setmode(G320x200x256);
   vga_setcolor(4);
   vga_drawpixel(10, 10);
 
   sleep(5);
   vga_setmode(TEXT);

   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

<p>This will paint a single red pixel on your screen. After five seconds,
it will reset your console to text mode and will exit.

<p>Note our first statement, vga_init() . This relinquishes root status
and initializes the SVGAlib library. The second line,
vga_setmode(G320x200x256) , sets the screen to mode 5, which is
320x200x256. That is to say, your screen becomes a grid which is 320
pixels wide, 200 pixels high, and which supports 256 colors. 
Alternatively, you could write vga_setmode(5).  Either statement is
acceptable. Our next command, vga_setcolor(4) , makes red the current
color. We can choose any value from 0 to 255.

<p><b>Basic Colors</b>

<p>In case you're interested, the 16 basic colors (for use with
vga_setcolor() ) are:

<p><pre>
0      - black.
1      - blue.
2      - green.
3      - cyan.
4      - red.
5      - magenta.
6      - brown.
7      - grey.
8      - dark grey (light black).
9      - light blue.
10     - light green.
11     - light cyan.
12     - light red.
13     - light magenta.
14     - yellow (light brown).
15     - white (light grey).
</pre>

<p>More colors are available with other commands, but we'll stick with
these basic colors for this example. Finally, we paint our pixel at
coordinate 10, 10 . This is eleven spaces right of the screen's left
border, and eleven spaces down.  It's eleven, not ten, because the
coordinate grid starts at 0.  Coordinate 0,0 is in the upper left-hand
corner. Vga_setmode(TEXT) returns the screen to text mode. 
Vga_setmode(TEXT) is identical to vga_setmode(0).  It's always nice to do
this at the end of your program. Otherwise, you'll make life difficult for
your users.

<p>To compile this code, use the regular gcc compiler. You'll also need to
link to SVGAlib with the -lvga command. Lastly, I suggest using -O3 , the
best level of optimization. So here's our command:

<p><pre>
gcc -O3 -o sample sample.c -lvga
</pre>

<p>Then, to make it usable by non-root accounts, type:

<p><pre>
chmod u+s
</pre>

<p>To execute, just type:

<p><pre>
sample     (or whatever you named it)
</pre>

<p>The complete set of SVGAlib commands is documented in the SVGAlib man
page. We won't go into all of them here, though. Instead, we'll write our
second sample program using a faster set of SVGAlib functions: vgagl .

<p>Type "man vgagl", and you'll see that vgagl is "a fast,
framebuffer-level graphics library based on SVGAlib." Basically, it gives
you advanced graphics functions, such as the ability to draw shapes with
one statement.

<p>Below is a program which uses vgagl. It should display a blue gradient
screen, just like the ones that some installation programs use. It starts
out as light blue on top of the screen, and gradually fades to black as it
moves down. One thing that it does differently than the first program is
that it does the drawing on an invisible "virtual" screen. When all the
lines have been drawn, it copies the finished picture to the visible
"physical" screen in one fell swoop. This eliminates screen flicker, and
makes your application look more professional.  I like to think of the
virtual screen as being "backstage", a place where "props" can be
assembled between "acts" in the show.

<p>To compile, I suggest typing:

<p><pre>
gcc -O3 -o gradient gradient.c -lvgagl -lvga
</pre>

<p>Note that -lvgagl comes before -lvga. It is mandatory that you refer to
vgagl first when using that library. Did you remember to chmod u+s ?

<p>Here's the code:

<p><pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;vga.h&gt;
#include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;

GraphicsContext *physicalscreen;
GraphicsContext *virtualscreen;
 
int main(void)
{
   int i,
       j,
       b,
       y,
       c;
 
   vga_init();
   vga_setmode(G320x200x256);
   gl_setcontextvga(G320x200x256);
   physicalscreen = gl_allocatecontext();
   gl_getcontext(physicalscreen);
   gl_setcontextvgavirtual(G320x200x256);
   virtualscreen = gl_allocatecontext();
   gl_getcontext(virtualscreen);
 
   gl_setcontext(virtualscreen);
   y = 0;
   c = 0;
   gl_setpalettecolor(c, 0, 0, 0);
   c++;
   for (i = 0; i < 64; i++)
   {
      b = 63 - i;
      gl_setpalettecolor(c, 0, 0, b);
      for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      {
         gl_hline(0, y, 319, c);
         y++;
      }
      c++;
   }
 
   gl_copyscreen(physicalscreen);
 
   vga_getch();
   gl_clearscreen(0);
   vga_setmode(TEXT);

   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

<p>Note that we now need to #include &lt;vgagl.h&gt;.

<p>We start our code by setting the graphics context:

<p><pre>
GraphicsContext *physicalscreen
GraphicsContext *virtualscreen
</pre>

<p>Then we'll declare our variables and use vga_setmode() to set the
screen mode. We'll use mode 5 (G320x200x256) like before.

<p>We need to initialize both the visible "physical" screen and the
invisible "virtual" screen. We then save the contexts into variables:

<p><pre>
gl_setcontextvga(G320x200x256)
physicalscreen = gl_allocatecontext()
gl_getcontext(physicalscreen)
gl_setcontextvgavirtual(G320x200x256)
virtualscreen = gl_allocatecontext()
gl_getcontext(virtualscreen)
</pre>

<p>We now announce that we'll be working with the virtual screen:
gl_setcontext(virtualscreen).

<p>Gl_setpalettecolor() gives us 64 shades of blue. We'll draw 3 lines per
shade, for a total of 192 lines. The remaining eight lines will be black
anyway, so they won't stand out.

<p>When we are finished, we copy the contents of the virtual screen (our
current screen) to the physical screen with gl_copyscreen(physicalscreen).

<p>This time, we'll let the user decide how long to leave the picture
visible. Getchar() waits for user input. After receiving a keystroke (any
key, it doesn't matter which), we gl_clearscreen(0) and vga_setmode(0) to
return to text.

<p>The entire set of functions for SVGAlib can be viewed by typing "man
svgalib" and "man vgagl". Then, each function has its own man page. After
reading this introduction, you should be able to insert new commands into
your own programs with relative ease. You also have the demo programs that
came with SVGAlib from which to learn.

<p>In the event that your distribution was incomplete, you can find the
latest version of SVGAlib at metalab.unc.edu in pub/Linux/libs/graphics or
at tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/libs . At the time of this writing,
the current version is 1.3.0.

<p>Finally, the Slackware distribution, while a good one, has a tendancy
to install SVGAlib to the wrong directories. Getting and installing a new
SVGAlib distribution from Metalab or MIT will fix that.

<p>Enjoy!
